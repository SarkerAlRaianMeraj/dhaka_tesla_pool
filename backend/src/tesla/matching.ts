/**
 * The pooling rule from `PRD_Dhaka_Tesla_Pool.md` §6.1, as a pure function.
 *
 * **The rule, in full:** two requests may share one Tesla if and only if their
 * pickup zones are identical AND their destination corridors overlap — meaning
 * they share at least one zone.
 *
 * ## Why a destination is not simply "in one corridor"
 *
 * A zone may belong to several corridors, and one of them decides the whole demo.
 * Mohakhali is in both `banani_gulshan` and `dhanmondi_farmgate`; Dhanmondi is in
 * both `dhanmondi_farmgate` and `bashundhara_east`. That is the only reason
 * Nusrat (Banani to Mohakhali), Rafiq (Banani to Gulshan 1), and Shirin (Banani to
 * Dhanmondi) can ride together in one Bullet: Mohakhali's pair with Dhanmondi
 * resolves through `dhanmondi_farmgate`, which both share with Mohakhali.
 *
 * An implementation that stored a single corridor per zone would call that third
 * pairing incompatible, and the failure would be invisible until Phase 4 tried to
 * pool three real riders. So the input here is a zone's *set* of corridors, and
 * corridor overlap is computed as set intersection over the zones each corridor
 * contains.
 *
 * ## Why nothing calls this yet
 *
 * The rule is pairwise — it answers "may these two requests share a Tesla", which
 * needs two requests. In Phase 3 a driver has no pool and therefore no first
 * request to compare against, so the feed lists `REQUESTED` rides and the
 * predicate has no caller (D27). It is written now, and verified now, precisely
 * because it is the rule most likely to be got subtly wrong; Phase 4 gives it an
 * anchor. `PRD` §5.4's traceability table lists a "matching unit" as part of D3's
 * evidence, which is why it carries a test now rather than in Phase 9.
